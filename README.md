We use Array Mesh functions to deform a mesh according to how close it is to a collision point. 

This is a small project to help wrap my head around Array Mesh functions in order to ultimately create a game about kicking stuff in a room or walking in snow and leaving imprints. 

I've avoided the use of shaders because ultimately I want the meshes to also have a collision shape that updates to conform to the new shape of the mesh.
